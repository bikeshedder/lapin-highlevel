# High level rust library for using RabbitMQ

This codebase is an experiment of how to wrap the excellent
[lapin](https://crates.io/crates/lapin) crate in a way that is more
ergonomic.

If this works out as planned it will be released on crates.io
and possibly become a part of
[deadpool-lapin](https://crates.io/crates/deadpool-lapin).
